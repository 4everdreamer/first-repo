void insertElement(int key, string element):
this method inserts a new element
first we need to know if the table isn't full
then we convert the given key into an index with the hashFunction
now, if the resulting index is already ocupied we jump to the next free index, remember to go round the array
create a new data item with the key and elements and save it in the correct index
