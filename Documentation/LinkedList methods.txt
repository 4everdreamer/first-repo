# getLastElement(): 
has a counter that starts from 0 and a pointer wich is going to be the last node at the end
theres a cycle wich is gonna cycle if the counter is lesser than the length of the list -1,
the counter is going to increment 1 by 1.
in the cycle we're going to advance the pointer to the pointee's next node
we finally return the lastNode

# void insertElement(int element)
it creates a new DataStructureNode with the given element as its element,
then it gets the last element in the list with the function getLastElement()
and if this node isn't null, it sets the node's rigth node to the new node
if it is null, then it sets the firstNode as the new node
in either of the two cases it adds 1 to the length
